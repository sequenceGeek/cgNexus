'''TODO:
  X 1) make attributes properties for non-[id] access
        a) this means make internal id tracker
    2) load everything on init (call it hints)
  X 3) make format files just a txt file 
        a) need good way to access them...
    3) load items as they are needed
        b) this is complicated cuz going through file every time
        you need to load something is SLOOOOW? or is it?
    4) fix the copy issue, should be able to return default w/o copy


SPEED
replace split with [:-1]
use str.split as splitIt (no dot)
    possibly switch to regex
try to get rid of for loops (use comprehension/map)
